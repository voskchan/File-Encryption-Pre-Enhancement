# File-Encryption-Pre-Enhancement
Pre Enhancement version of File Encryption program for CS 499

This version of the File encryption application uses a hardcoded password for the XOR cipher. It will take an input file and output two files. One file will have the encrypted data and the other file will have the data that is decrypted again in order to show that the cipher works.
